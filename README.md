A multi-agent system built with **CrewAI** that uses **machine learning** to predict weather conditions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **weather forecasting backend** that combines:

- **Real-time weather data** from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)  
- **Machine learning predictions** using a **Random Forest model**  
- **Multi-agent orchestration** with **CrewAI**  
- **Flask web API** for serving predictions
